/**
 * The hero carousel's image source list — real, photorealistic vehicle
 * photography (Phase 4.1), one image per fleet category, replacing the
 * Phase 4 placeholder SVGs. Every image is composed with the vehicle on
 * the right two-thirds of the frame and clean negative space on the left,
 * so the headline/CTA (rendered at the inline-start side — see
 * HeroCarousel.tsx) stays readable over the image in both LTR and RTL.
 *
 * Copy (title/body) is NOT duplicated here — it stays in the i18n
 * `hero.slides` array (en.ts/ar.ts) exactly as it already existed, so this
 * file only adds the image (and alt text key) each translated slide pairs
 * with, by index. To swap or add a slide's image later, change only the
 * entry below; HeroCarousel.tsx itself never needs to change.
