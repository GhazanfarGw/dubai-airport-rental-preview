/**
 * Manage Booking — single-field lookup. Guest checkout has no auth session
 * (see ConfirmationPage.tsx / docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), so this is the only
 * way a customer can check their booking status later, from a different
 * browser or device, or after their same-browser sessionStorage
 * confirmation snapshot is gone.
 *
 * Follow-up request (made directly in chat, after Phase 7 shipped):
 * replace the original reference+email pairing with ONE field that
 * accepts EITHER the booking reference OR the vehicle's plate number.
 * This is a deliberate, owner-approved reduction from this project's usual
 * "two values must match together" pattern — see the
 * lookup_booking_for_customer() migration's own header for the full
 * trade-off explanation. Calls that SECURITY DEFINER RPC, which returns
 * zero rows when the query matches neither a reference nor a plate.
